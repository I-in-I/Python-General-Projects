According to Edmunds, the average new car transaction in June was just shy of the record $41,000 set in May, and up 10% from June 2019. The average used car price soared even more, rising 28% in that two-year period to reach a record $26,500.
The real winners in this current price environment? Car dealers.
Dealers are independently owned businesses that buy new cars from automakers at fixed prices. And those wholesale prices have generally not increased of late, leading to unprecedented profit margins on new car sales.
Typically, selling new cars is the least profitable sector of a car dealer's business. Used car sales are more profitable, while service and repairs account for the most lucrative part of the business.
The overwhelming majority of dealerships are privately owned, although there are a handful of publicly traded dealer groups, led by AutoNation (AN), the nation's largest, with roughly 2% of the US market. But whether it's a publicly-traded group or a single, locally-owned dealer, these are the very best of times, said Ali Faghri, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners, who follows dealership stocks.
